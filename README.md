# ME495 Embedded Systems Homework 3
Author: Damien Koh

## Repository Description
This repository contains two packages, `diff_drive` and `pickmeup`, to demonstrate the use of Gazebo and my group's own MoveIt class respectively.

For the `pickmeup` package to be used properly, our group's `motion_plan_pkg` will be required. More detailed setup instructions will be detailed below.

## diff_drive

### Quickstart
1. Use `ros2 launch diff_drive ddrive_rviz.launch.xml` to view the diff_drive robot in rviz.
2. Use `ros2 launch diff_drive ddrive.launch.xml` to simulate the diff_drive robot flipping in Gazebo and view it in rviz with the appropriate configuration.

### Videos

Here is a video of the flipping diff_drive simulation running in Gazebo:
